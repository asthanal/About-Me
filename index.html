            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Laboni.  Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!  A little bit about myself, I grew up in a university environment as both of my parents were professors.  So, I too was influenced by them and decided to get into education.  I got my Bachelors in Education and an Associate in Computer Information Systems, as computers have always facinated me!  I also have a love for sweets(but no chocolates, I'm weird like that!), traveling and learning about different cultures, and my crazy passion about visiting wildlife safaris whenever I can!</p>
